            <br/>
            your submission has to be a pattern any pattern any color anything you want but if you want to contact me
            <br/>

            <h1>General Updates!</h1>
            <p>March-December 2022</p>
            <b>March:</b>ok so march doesn't have alot of updates a main update though is the site it's self being created
            <br/>
            below and here are the updates: <b>links added as well as colors for choosen sections and I nice lil logo</b>
            <br/>
            and the rest is just upcoming updates: <b>new backgrounds, games, new pages and more diffrent colors maybe a login/sign up</b>
            <br/>
            that should be all the updates until I come up with more to add and the reason the updates are in bold is so that
            <br/>
            you don't have to look for them also I said maybe login/sign up is if I can get the code so that other people
            <br/>
            can put news and links forums etc. it really depends on the code anyway that should be it for now bye.
            <br/>
            <h1>News About Games</h1>
            <p>March 27 2022</p>
            ok so I know your probably are like where the hell are the games on my own site not right now
            <br/>
            I will in an update in like a few weeks cause I have school and if you came here to play games
            <br/>
