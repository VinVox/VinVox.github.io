            Your canvas size has to be 256 x 240 pixels
            <br/>
             and find an image (or draw one)  and scale it down to your canvas size
             <br/>
             divide your canvas into a grid of 16x16 pixel squares
             <br/>
             each 16x16  square can only have 3 colors plus black
             <br/>
             thats about it! hope it works for you.
