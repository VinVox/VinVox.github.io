        hello welcome to VinVox.com this is a site mainly used for my Newgrounds account
        <br/>
        my Newgrounds is below just in case
        <br/>
        <b>About Me</b>
        <br/>
        ok so anyway I make games
        <br/>
        now you may be asking what do you do to make games
        <br/>
        art,music,design? no programming I also co-founded LoonCadets Studios
        <br/>
        if you want to learn how to make game first I would recommend starting with scratch
        <br/>
        scratch is coding blocks (same with construct but more advanced with construct)
        <br/>
        then I would recommend start writing code with notepad,notepad++ Or visual studio (code)
        <br/>
        it's ok to use videos or Tutorials it's not cheating
        <br/>
        the more programming language's you learn the more sites and games you can make
        <br/>
        most language's are for sites like php html etc.
        <br/>
        but mainly language's you want to use for games are
        <br/>
        C#(like unity a 3d or 2d game engine) Javascript,actionscript and (html)
        <br/>
